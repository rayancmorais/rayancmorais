**Hi!** 👋 I'm Rayan Morais, a Full-Stack Developer focused on building robust digital solutions.

My passion for both front-end and back-end development allows me to create complete and efficient applications. With **JavaScript** and **Node.js**, I ensure dynamic and reusable interfaces through **componentization**, using **Styled Components** and **Tailwind CSS** for clean styling.

On the front end, I build fluid experiences with **ReactJS** and **React Native**, mastering hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useReducer` to manage application state effectively. On the back end, I construct powerful **APIs** with **Express** and manage data with **MongoDB**. I use **Postman** to test and validate API functionality.

Currently, I'm a **Software Engineering student**, which deepens my technical expertise and prepares me for increasingly complex industry challenges.

I'm fluent in both Portuguese and English, always open to feedback, and eager to collaborate on innovative projects.
